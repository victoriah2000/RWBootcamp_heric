# Sandwich Saturation

The preloaded sandwich data is stored in the main bundle as JSON data.  It could be stored in another format such as PLIST as Felipe described.  This format tends to not be used that commonly and is more difficult to maintain so JSON makes more sense.  It could also stored as an iTunes store resource if there were hundreds of sandwiches (and images) to load.  In-app-puchase packs!
